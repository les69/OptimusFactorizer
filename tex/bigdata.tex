In this paper we provide an extensive analysis of the actual state of the
art of recommendation systems.\\
\textit{Collaborative Filtering} is the current buzzword in the
world of recommendations, came to notoriety after the Netflix Prize
challenge. In this paper we aim to analyze the current implementations
of two different algorithms used for Collaborative Filtering: \textbf{ALS} and \textbf{Stochastic
Gradient Descent} in combination with the common frameworks \texttt{Spark} and  \texttt{Flink}.

\section{Introduction}

Recommender systems are now trending due to the overwhelming availability
of data. These systems have the ability to discover hidden relationships between
users and items, and use these patterns to improve the user's taste prediction.
Reserachers discovered a "neighbourhood" of users with a similar taste
which can be revealed by their previous actions: both implicit and explicit.
\texttt{Collaborative filtering} is by far the most common approach adapted also by
some of the biggest companies in the IT sector such as: \textbf{Amazon}, \textbf{Facebook} and \textbf{Netflix}.
Altough it's massive presence in the market \texttt{CF} is not the only approach
available for a recommender system, but it is actually the successor of
\texttt{Content-Based filtering}. The latter aims to profile a user searching
the correlation with the item's peculiarity. By item peculiarity we refer to
its implicit and explicit characteristics, for example a song's genre,
subgenre, writer, composer, year of composition, beats per second etc.
The problem with this approach lays in the difficult of retrieving all the necessary
information, which sometimes are not even available or discloable.
Furthermore with the raise of the BigData paradigm some frameworks started to grow from
the accademic world to the Apache Foundation: \textbf{Flink} and \textbf{Spark}.
Those frameworks can be seen an extension of the Hadoop ecosystem, and both of them
have their own pros and contros which will be briefly analyzed further in this paper.






\section{Collaborative Filtering}

The paper is structured as follow: description in more details
of \texttt{Collaborative Filtering} with it's problems, what are
the most commong algorithms used with \texttt{CF} and a brief
introduction to both \textbf{Flink} and \textbf{Spark}.



\subsection{Collaborative Filtering Approaches}


Collaborative Filtering can be subsenquently defined in two
different approaches:

\subsubsection{Memory-based Content Filtering}
In \texttt{memory-based CF} uses user ratings to compute similarity
between user and items and subsequently make a recommendation. Usually
this approach involves "neighboring" algorithms such as \texbf{K-Nearest Neighbours}
to build relationships between users. The similarity between two users
is calculated using the \textbf{cosine similarity}.\\
\textbf{Cosine similarity} is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.[4]
\begin{equation}
\cos ({\bf t},{\bf e})= {{\bf t} {\bf e} \over \|{\bf t}\| \|{\bf e}\|} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}{{\bf t}_i{\bf e}_i} }{ \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({\bf t}_i)^2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({\bf e}_i)^2}} }
\end{equation}
The recommendation is made by finding the top K similar users and aggregate their
user-item matrices to find the appropriate recommendation.
The typical problem of this approach is the difficult with scaling
when the data gets bigger. Due to the \texttt{BigData} paradigm expansion
this approach has been deprecated favoring the following approach.


\subsubsection{Model-based Content Filtering}
The most common approach to \texttt{CF} is through the factorization
of a very big and sparse matrix.[3] For example during the Netflix
Prize at the participans were given a matrix of 8.5 billions of ratings,
of which only 100 millions were non zero values.
\textit{Model-based CF} uses machine-learning and data mining algorithms
to uncover the latent factor model between users and items to
predict the missing ratings.\texbf{latent factor models} are hidden
relationships between users and items hardly discoverable in the original data;
usually they may for example denote the quantity of action in a movie or the complexity
of the characters.These vectors are then used to create the missing values in the user-items
matrix.\\
But what about the error of the prediction? There's an error function better known as
\textbf{Root Mean Square Error} which is used to calculate the difference
between the real and the predicted value.\\
\begin{equation}
{\sqrt {\frac{1} {N}{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {(c_{i} - \bar{c}_{i} } })^{2} } }
\end{equation}

Furthermore the model-based content filtering can be expanded in two distinct sections:
\textit{user and item based content filtering} depending on the priority given to the
prediction.


\subsection{Related problems}
\subsubsection{Cold start problem}
Due to the nature of CF, the system needs a huge amount of data
in order to produce a reliable prediction. But what happens if our system
hasn't collected any or not enough information yet?
This problem is called \textbf{cold start} and can be tackled with some advanced
machine learning solutions called \textit{active learning}.

\subsubsection{Shilling Attacks}
CF can be exploited to perturbate its prediction system with a technique
called \textit{shilling attacks}. This happens when the input system (e.g. ratings)
are given in the correct way trying to alter the recommendations to the one
favoured by the attacker. It has also been noticed that these kind of attacks affect
more user-based CF algorithms insted of item-based.[5]

\subsubsection{Sparsity}

Another problem related to CF is the sparsity


\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
\textbf{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ system will convert
\textbf{.eps} to \textbf{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

that needs to span two columns of text.}

\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has
been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
